    "Task - Linear regression Aim Perform a linear regression analysis (of your slice) of the Instacart dataset, predicting the number of days between orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detail The problem to solve takes the form of Linear Regression with categorical independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sequence of orders placed by a customer. The hypothesis is that the typical product mix for that customer can be used to predict when the next order will be placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For training data, take an 80% subset of \"relevant\" orders, across all \"relevant\" users. From the first to the second last order, determine the product mix for that user, as well as the number of days until the next order for that user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data is the remaining 20% subset of \"relevant\" orders, across all \"relevant\" users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there were just 1 user and that user placed 11 orders, the training set could include the product mixes for each of the following 8 orders: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, together with the \"days between orders\" for each of the 8 order pairs (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (9,10), (10,11). In this case, the test data would include the product mix for order 3 and 8, together with the \"days between orders\" for each of the 2 order pairs (3,4) and (8,9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the proposed 80:20 split is across user x order combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in practice, relevant implies an unbiased subset chosen to make the problem tractable with the computing resources available to each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Independent variables, the product (mix) for order i-1 can be used, and the Dependent variable is the number of days between order i-1 and order i in that sequence for a given user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the number of observations in the observation matrix is the number of users times the number of orders for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are 49688 distinct products, the dimensionality of the problem is very high, so students need to take account of this using:\n",
    "\n",
    "roll up to aisle (134 unique) or department (21 unique) and build model accordingly use PCA to reduce the dimensions (of products, aisles and/or departments), and solve using the reduced-dimension model use regularisation and fit a constrained model. Disclaimers/Comments It is possible to obtain either per-user predictions (by solving a separate regression problem for each user) or a user-agnostic prediction (by merging the data for many users). It would be interesting to try both and compare, explaining what you find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of this task relates to dimensionality reduction. In traditional BI, this would be done using roll-ups (e.g., from product to aisle), but linear regression offers other options. The BI approach is easier to interpret, because of the \"meaningful\" labels, but does it work as well? Give reasons for your answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "Validating the results requires analysis of the outputs (and not just the predictions) of the linear regression model, e.g., R-squared and any other metrics you believe are helpful here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading Outline 3 x 25% for each of the 3 regression model x dimensionality reduction options above, where the 25% consists of 5% Visualisation 10% formulation and solving 10% Validation/Comments/analysis. 25% for comparing per-user and multi-user models, and different methods for dimensionality reduction."
